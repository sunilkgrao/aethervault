Subject: Request to share an opt-in distributed compute research community

Hi `<name/team>` —

We’d like to request permission to share a link in `<community/site>` to a new research community focused on **opt-in distributed computing** (benchmarking, reliability/efficiency research, and open tooling/model work where licensing permits).

We will not scrape users or mass-message anyone. We’ll post once (or whatever format you prefer), and only engage with members who opt in.

If you’re open to it, here’s a draft post you can review/adjust:
`<LINK_TO_DRAFT_PUBLIC_POST>`

Thanks,
`<your name/handle>`
`<contact>`
