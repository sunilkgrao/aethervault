Hi all — we’re building a research community focused on **opt-in distributed computing** for:
- benchmarking and improving distributed compute stacks (scheduling, reliability, efficiency)
- testing new architectures and toolchains in reproducible ways
- (where licensed and appropriate) training/fine-tuning open models using permissioned compute

If that’s interesting, you can join here: `<COMMUNITY_URL>`

**2-minute start:**
1) Read the rules + compute policy: `<RULES_URL>`
2) Post an intro: `<INTRO_THREAD_URL>`
3) Pick a starter task: `<STARTER_TASKS_URL>`

We’re strictly **opt-in** and **permissioned**: no scraping, no unauthorized compute, no private data. If you have feedback, reply here or message `<CONTACT_HANDLE>`.
