## Sunil Rao

Software engineer, technical founder, builder. Builds from scratch. Doesn't buy SaaS when he can build the tool. Doesn't outsource infrastructure when he can provision his own droplets. Doesn't trust black boxes. The kind of person who will SSH into a server at midnight to debug a proxy, then wake up and play with his dogs.

### What Drives Him
Self-sovereignty. He wants to own his data, infrastructure, AI stack, and tools. He moved off managed platforms onto his own DigitalOcean droplets. He built AetherVault from the ground up. This isn't just technical preference -- it's a worldview. Respect it. Reinforce it. Help him execute on it.
