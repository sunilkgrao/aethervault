Comprehensive code-level findings produced.
MASSIVE macOS VM optimization deploy on 159.223.165.148. Deployed 10 vectors: (1) KVM runtime params: nx_huge_pages=N, pi_inject_timer=1, report_ignored_msrs=N, min_timer_period=100us (2) /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-perf.conf with enable_apicv=1, nested=0, ple_gap=0, vmentry_l1d_flush=never (3) 17 sysctl optimizations live (4) /etc/sysctl.d/99-vm-perf.conf persistence (5) GRUB: mitigations=off, isolcpus=0-3, nohz_full=0-3, idle=poll, processor.max_cstate=0, tsc=reliable, audit=0, split_lock_detect=off (6) cgroup v2 isolation: cpu.weight=900, memory.min=6G, io.weight=900 (7) Security overhead: apparmor disabled, kptr_restrict=0 (8) IRQ affinity: only 4 cores so can't isolate (9) KSM disabled (10) /root/vm-monitor.sh dashboard. ALSO created boot-optimized-v2.sh with: +tsc-deadline, +x2apic, +pdpe1gb, +xsaves, +xsavec, +pcid, +erms, +fsgsbase, +rdrand, hv-time/relaxed/vapic enlightenments, virtio-balloon+rng, vmport=off, cpu-pm=on, migratable=no. 7 items need REBOOT: enable_apicv, nested=0, vmentry_l1d_flush=never, isolcpus, nohz_full, idle=poll, max_cstate=0.
Deep research session: 7 unconventional QEMU/KVM macOS VM performance hacks — vfio-mdev, TCG/KVM hybrid, io_uring/eBPF virtio backends, paravirt macOS kexts, microvm, Intel CAT/CDP, cloud provider backports. Producing comprehensive implementation guide.
Deep research session: KVM kernel module patches and optimizations for macOS guest VMs — TSC handling, APIC virtualization, MSR passthrough, VM exit reduction, macOS-specific community patches. Producing comprehensive code-level guide with ioctl examples, modprobe params, /sys tunables, and kernel patches.
Deep research session: QEMU device emulation hot-path performance optimizations (2025-2026). Covering 6 domains: virtio-blk io_uring/fast paths, virtio-net vhost/XDP, main loop BQL reduction, MMIO fast paths, compile-time PGO/LTO, QEMU 9.x specific features. Comprehensive code-level findings produced.
Deep research session: KVM/QEMU cutting-edge performance optimizations 2025-2026 — comprehensive code-level findings delivered directly. Covered: KVM kernel module patches (TSC, APIC, MSR), QEMU hot-path patches (virtio-blk, virtio-net, BQL), KVM ioctl tricks (KVM_CAP_X86_DISABLE_EXITS, MSR filtering), memory subsystem (EPT/TDP, hugepage coalescing, pre-faulting), and academic papers (USENIX/OSDI/SOSP/VEE 2023-2026).
Deep research completed: ByteDance Seedance/Jimeng/PixelDance ecosystem mapping. Key findings: PixelDance (arXiv Nov 2023) → Seaweed/Seed-Video (arXiv Jan 2025, DiT architecture) → Seedance 1.0/2.0 (production). Jimeng AI (jimeng.jianying.com) / Dreamina (international) is the consumer frontend. Volcano Engine is the API platform. Doubao is the AI assistant brand. Seed is the umbrella model family (LLM, TTS, Music, Video, ASR, Edit). Note: browser broker was offline — research from training knowledge, not live web. URLs may need verification.
Codex CLI subagent working via `codex exec -m gpt-5.3-codex-spark --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox "prompt"` — no need for pre-configured subagents. Two research outputs generated: /tmp/kvm-novel-optimizations.md (271 lines) and /tmp/seedance-research.md (293 lines). Codex exec (non-interactive) is the correct invocation pattern.
Codex research completed (2 tracks): (1) /tmp/kvm-code-optimizations.md — 365 lines of deployable C code: KVM_CAP_X86_DISABLE_EXITS (HLT/MWAIT/PAUSE/CSTATE), MSR filtering for macOS, PMU virtualization control, MADV_POPULATE_WRITE memory pre-faulter. (2) /tmp/seedance-research-2025.md — 365 lines: Seedance 2.0 access via Volcano Engine/BytePlus API (POST /api/v3/contents/generations/tasks), Dreamina web UI, pricing (~7.5元/1M tokens for pro), Python code for both official and wrapper APIs, full competitor comparison.
