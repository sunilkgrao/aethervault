Completed 3-agent Codex audit of AetherVault's own codebase (~81K lines). Agents: (1) Security audit of hooks, (2) Performance/architecture audit of main.rs, (3) Reliability audit of hooks + vendor core. All findings captured in conversation. Key risks: MCP gateway command injection (HIGH), scale.py token in process args (HIGH), codex hook sandbox bypass (HIGH), unbounded request body parsing, 8 unwrap() calls in main.rs, race conditions in hot_memory_store, silent data loss in WAL truncation paths.
