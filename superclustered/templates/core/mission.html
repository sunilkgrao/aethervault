  <div class="sc-prose">
    <p>
      TachyonGrid is a <strong>directed</strong> collaboration network. The purpose is to accelerate research and engineering
      towards a large-scale, efficient, distributed supercompute cluster by coordinating:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>reproducible benchmarking and evaluation</li>
      <li>architecture and systems research (scheduling, networking, storage, fault tolerance, efficiency)</li>
      <li>permissioned, opt-in distributed compute to run experiments and (where licensing permits) train and improve open models</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="sc-meta">
      This is not a general-purpose social network. Posts should be aligned to the mission and written for reproducibility.
    </p>
